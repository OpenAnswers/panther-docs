## Event Rules

Create new rules to discard, de-duplicate, prioritize or categorize your events.

Groups and group rules allow you to categorize events and apply
specific logic to specific groups of events.

Agent rules allow you to access more metadata from the protocol in
question, such as structured data from RFC5424 syslog messages. Garbage
messages can be discarded earlier.
